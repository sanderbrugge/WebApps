# WebApps
Github repository for the OLOD WebApps (third year).

# HEROKU

This MEAN app can be accessed via the following [link](https://videre-webapps.herokuapp.com)

* https://videre-webapps.herokuapp.com

## Side-note:

Due to the fact that package.json is *not* the root dir in this github repo, I'm using another repo which is in sync with this one to deploy to Heroku. Will add the url to that github here later.
