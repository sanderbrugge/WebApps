# WebApps
Github repository of a project to educate myself in the world of MEAN-stack. This project is build using Angular 5.0, nodeJS, mongo and expressJS.

# Purpose

This is sort of a youtube clone where users can view a public list of available videos, watch a specific video in a detail modal. If a user wishes to like, comment or upload a video of his own he has to login or register a new account.

This app follows the best practices as described in the Angular guidelines and tought me the following:

* Create a new Angular Web App,
* Create a front end and style it with Semantic UI,
* Create an express back end with ExpressJS,
* connect backend and frontend with routes,
* Persist data in a MongoDB using Mongoose and schema's.

# HEROKU

This MEAN app can be accessed via the following [link](https://videre-webapps.herokuapp.com)

* https://videre-webapps.herokuapp.com

But it's not linked to any online MongoDB, only locally.

## Side-note:

Due to the fact that package.json is *not* the root dir in this github repo, I'm using another repo which is in sync with this one to deploy to Heroku.

## Disclaimer

The UI aspects of this project are build with Semantic UI, and a lot of components are from the tutorial/examples on their website. This because CSS and Layout in general were not the goal of this project.

It is also not intended to sell, distribute or otherwise gain anything from it other than the educational value. Only made public for any future references.
